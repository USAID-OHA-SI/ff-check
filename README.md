Flat files validation for Datim Import

## Objective
Facilitate and accelerate the pre-validation, reporting and analyses of `Datim Quarterly Data Submissions` from Implementing Partners. This should help country M&E Advisers do most of the checks and transformations locally as partners send in their reports. 

## Steps

1. Get submissions as flat files (.csv)
2. Read and do some initial validation the content
3. Get back to partners with errors / confirmation
4. Convert data into structured datasets (Genie / Pano like)
5. Do some more in depth validations
6. Aggregate, analyses and report on performance

## Sample flow

coming soon ...:)
